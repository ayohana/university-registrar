## User Stories

* As a registrar, I want to enter a student, so I can keep track of all students enrolled at this University. I should be able to provide a name and date of enrollment.
* As a registrar, I want to enter a course, so I can keep track of all of the courses the University offers. I should be able to provide a course name and a course number (ex. HIST100).
* As a registrar, I want to be able to assign students to a course, so that teachers know which students are in their course. A course can have many students and a student can take many courses at the same time.
